# CQL Quarter Calculator

Simple CQL Development Repo using a Previous Quarter to a Date example. 

# To run

Load the project on IntelliJ Idea, find the `QuarterCalculatorTest` class in Run the class. You should see the test cases defined in the CQL file in the Test Run view of Idea.

This is a gradle project, thus: 

```
./gradlew test
```

also works.
